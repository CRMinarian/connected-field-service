| :------------------------ |
| The goal of this repo is to give you everything you need to set up a Connected Field Service ( CFS ) Environment. |

## Getting Started with Environments

In the Guides folder you'll find many resources to get you going.

## Physical IoT device prototyping

Find your target device in [firmware code samples](https://github.com/gregdegruy/iot-central-firmware) that I contribute too and you should too! Please submit a PR for any supported devices or bugs you find.

## Example CFS Implementations
